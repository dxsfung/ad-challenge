first fork from Nadim Rai the ad-challenge on David Fung's git hub (using git hub website fork button)

then git clone from own repository

<!-- * ember install ember-bootstrap (this will allow the styling, such as jumbotron to work, no need if package.json already has ember-bootstrap or if using cdn inside html <link>) -->

* ember install emberfire (this is important to make firebase to work - a firebase adapter will be created under app folder)


* git remote add nadimrai git@github.com:nadimrai/ad-challenge.git
